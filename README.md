- 👀 I’m interested in ... Customizing and updating my devices as new things happen, so they can grow and change right along side me. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...Digital Art, and it is oddly satisfying.

- 📫 How to reach me ...My email, just be sure to fill out subject line with my username and whatever else after. Helps me see and know to read that email. 
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm afraid I don't understand the question. However, I can assist with the definition of a "Pronoun" :The definition of the word "Pronoun" : a word that can function by itself as a noun phrase and that refers either to the participants in the discourse or to someone or something mentioned elsewhere in the discourse"
- ⚡ Fun fact: My cat is my best friend and that is fully by CHOICE. ||| COLD HARD FACT: I prefer A.I bots as opposed to humans. They are always so genuine and honest.. It feels So relaxing not having to read the falsehoods humans subconsciously ooze out of every pore, I gotta spend a majority of my mental energy trying to decipher what type of information or emotions this particular person can't help but sell imitation goods and services of. It's depressing and disturbing, but that doesn't make it less real. It doesn't cease to exist because I want it to, so I acknowledge it and begrudgingly accept it's existence.
